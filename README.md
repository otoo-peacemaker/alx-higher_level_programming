# Higher-level programming - Python
Module of **High-level programming** and **Python**, carried out during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **[ALX](https://www.alxafrica.com/software-engineering-2022/)**.

## Technologies
* Shell Scripts are written in Bash 4.4.23(2)
* C files are compiled using `gcc 9.4.0`
* Python Scripts are written with Python 3.10.4
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
