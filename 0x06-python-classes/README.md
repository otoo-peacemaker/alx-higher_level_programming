# Classes and Objects

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX School**. It aims to learn about object oriented programming (OOP), classes, objects, instances, methods and attributes in **Python**.

## Technologies
* Shell Scripts are written in Bash 4.4.23(2)
* Python Scripts are written with Python 3.10.4
* C files are compiled using `gcc 9.4.0`
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
